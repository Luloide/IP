That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Every bait and switch was a work of art
Yeah, that's my man
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Wreck my plans
Begging for you to take my hand
Anywhere else is hollow
You know that my train could take you home
That's my man
Wreck my plans
Begging for you to take my hand
I follow
Wherever you stray
The less I know
The more that you say
That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Anywhere else is hollow
You know that my train could take you home
That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
I follow
Wherever you stray
The less I know
The more that you say
Every bait and switch was a work of art
Guess I should've known from the look on your face
Now this is an open-shut case
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Anywhere else is hollow
You know that my train could take you home
That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
I follow
Wherever you stray
The less I know
The more that you say
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
As if you were a mythical thing
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (oh)
That's my man
Wreck my plans
I'm begging for you to take my hand
I follow
Wherever you stray
The less I know
The more that you say
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
I never would've known from that look on your face
And if it was an open-shut case
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
